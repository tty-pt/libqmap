# libqmap
> A small library for in-memory hashtables or dictionaries

## Installation
Check out [these instructions](https://github.com/tty-pt/ci/blob/main/docs/install.md#install-ttypt-packages).
And use "libqmap" as the package name.

## Usage
If you have an editor that uses a language server, then you'll get help about the functions in it.

But you can also run stuff like:
```sh
man qmap_open # Library function
man qmap # The tool
```

Have a look at [the cli tool's source code](https://github.com/tty-pt/qmap/blob/main/src/qmap.c) too, if you want.
